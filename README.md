# Fanuc Robot Programs Fall 2022

To do next:
- Figure out piano (power, volume, etc.)
- Find how accurate the current models in RViz are to the real world
- Determine positions for the table and piano (and mark with tape) and set those positions in RViz
- Convert RViz XYZ units into real-world coordinates (e.g. meters)
- Figure out how to control claw, and see if its fingers can reach far enough to play an octave

Future:
- Create a state machine model that can play a note
- Open and close claw to play two notes at once
- Play a song from a list of positions
- Play black notes
 
Optional feature ideas:
- Play a song from a list of notes
- Use a camera to find the piano and position itself accordingly
- Have the robot turn the piano on and off automatically
- Fix the play in the claw
