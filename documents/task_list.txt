To do next:
 - Get keyboard to work
 - Use tape to mark a set position for the table AND the keyboard
 - Find out how to move with XYZ coordinates (instead of just joint rotations)
 - Figure out the accuracy of the current models in RViz (especially for the table)
 - Figure out what units are used by Larry for its XYZ positions
 - Learn how to control claw (and see if it can play an octave)

Future:
 - Play a note using the state machine model
 - Add black notes
 - Play a song from an array/file of positions
 - (Optional) Play a song from a list of notes
 - (Optional) Use camera to find keyboard
 - (Optional) Have robot turn the keyboard on and off
